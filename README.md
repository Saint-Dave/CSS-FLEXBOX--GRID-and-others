NOTES (learning to us Readme for my projects)

/* NOTE:
I designed the FlexBox exactly to the responsive screen size of
WIDTH = 1440px and,
HEIGHT = 800px
as required. And just like the image size */

/* NOTE:
I designed the Mobile responsive screen to the exact size of
WIDTH = 375px and,
HEIGHT = 667px
as required. */

/* NOTE:
I designed the grid exactly to the responsive screen size of
WIDTH = 910px and,
HEIGHT = 554px
exactly as the sample image.

PS; I used Adobe Photoshop to get the exact color of each grid as well as to confirm the sizes.*/
